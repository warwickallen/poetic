" Dumps the syntax highlighting Vim assigns to the current buffer, one
" source line per output line, as space-separated "[text run]=group" pairs.
"
" Uses synID(..., 0) (untranslated) so the dump reflects poem.vim's own
" group names (e.g. "poemTitle") rather than whatever builtin group they
" happen to be `:hi link`ed to -- keeping the result independent of
" colorscheme, terminal capabilities, and TOhtml's output format, all of
" which vary across machines and Vim versions.
"
" Assumes the buffer contains only single-byte characters (true of the
" checked-in fixture): synID()'s {col} and strpart()'s offsets are both
" byte-based, so this loop would need byteidx() conversions to stay correct
" for multibyte text.
"
" Expects the buffer to already be loaded and syntax-highlighted (filetype
" set, `:syntax enable` run) by the caller. Reads $DUMP_OUT for the output
" path. See test/vim-syntax.test.js for the full invocation.
"
" The analysis section's prose is highlighted by Vim's bundled markdown.vim,
" which poem.vim delegates to via `contains=`. Its group names -- and the exact
" character runs they cover -- drift between Vim versions (e.g. 9.1 recognises
" ~~strikethrough~~ and tags fenced code as markdownCodeBlock where 8.2 leaves
" the text as prose / markdownCode), so pinning them would make this golden
" depend on the installed Vim. This fixture is a regression test for poem.vim's
" OWN groups, so every builtin markdown* group is folded into poemAnalysis (the
" group poem.vim gives the surrounding prose); adjacent runs then merge and the
" dump becomes independent of the installed Vim's markdown syntax. Because that
" folding would let a broken `contains=@poemMarkdown` wiring pass unnoticed here,
" test/vim-syntax.test.js also runs a separate, version-tolerant smoke check
" (test/fixtures/dump-syntax-groups.vim) asserting that at least one raw,
" unfolded markdown* group appears somewhere in the analysis section.
