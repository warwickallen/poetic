# Tech debt

Deferred work and known gaps in the Poetic framework. Record an entry here
whenever you defer something, rather than leaving it only in a commit message or
in chat. Keep entries short and dated. Once an issue has been resolved, remove
its `## <id> <title>` section below — but never remove its row from the
Ledger table at the bottom of this file; see "Ledger" below.

Format:
```
## <id> <short title>

A description of what, why it matters, where, and a suggested fix.

```
Where `<id>` is a literal "TD" then the date followed by a zero-padded
sequential number (starting at 1 for the the first entry of a day). I.e.:
**TD*YYMMDDNN***. `NN` is one more than the highest `NN` already used for
that date **in the Ledger table**, not just what's currently visible above
it — a resolved entry's body is removed, but its Ledger row stays forever,
so the Ledger (not memory or scrollback) is the source of truth for the next
free ID. Compute it with `scripts/next-tech-debt-id.pl` rather than counting
by hand.

## Claiming an item

Before starting work on an open item, confirm nobody else already has:
check its Ledger row is `open` (not `in-progress`), and skim open pull
requests for its ID. Then:

1. Flip its Ledger row's Status to `in-progress`.
2. Push a branch and open a **draft** pull request right away — before the
   fix is finished — so `gh pr list` shows it's claimed. The first commit
   can be the Ledger status flip itself.
3. Do the work, pushing further commits to the same branch/PR.
4. Once verified, flip the Ledger row to `resolved` (fill in `Resolved` and
   `Ref`), remove the entry's `## <id>` section, and mark the PR ready for
   review.

If a claim is abandoned (the draft PR is closed without merging), flip the
row back to `open`.

## TD26071111 Incremental-rebuild dependency tracking is approximate

The mtime-based rebuild skip (`src/tools/needs-rebuild.js`, wired into
`poem-to-yaml.js`, `build-poems.js`, `build-all-poems.js`, and
`poem-to-raw.js`) makes two simplifying assumptions instead of full
dependency-graph tracking. (1) A poem's `$ref` targets are assumed to be
underscore-prefixed YAML partials in the same directory
(`build-poems.js`'s `partialYamlPaths`) — a `$ref` to a non-underscore-prefixed
file is invisible to the staleness check, so editing such a file alone won't
invalidate poems that reference it. (2) A directory passed as an input (e.g.
`poemsDir` in `build-all-poems.js`, to catch poems being added/removed) relies
on the OS bumping the directory's own mtime when a direct child changes,
which isn't guaranteed on every filesystem or by every sync/copy tool. Both
are accepted trade-offs, not bugs — the correct general fix is real
dependency-graph tracking (parsing every poem's actual `$ref` targets, and/or
recording a manifest of known source files instead of relying on directory
mtimes), which is more complex than this codebase's scale currently
justifies. Revisit only if either gap causes an actual stale-build incident.
Referenced from a comment in `build-poems.js` (next to `partialYamlPaths`) —
remove that reference too when this is resolved.

## Ledger

Every tech-debt ID ever allocated — open, in-progress, or resolved — is
listed here forever, in ID order. This is what makes numbering unambiguous:
the next free ID for a given date is one more than the highest `NN` seen
below for that date, regardless of whether the corresponding entry still has
a body above.
