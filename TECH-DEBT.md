# Tech debt

Deferred work and known gaps in the Poetic framework. Record an entry here
whenever you defer something, rather than leaving it only in a commit message or
in chat. Keep entries short and dated. Live items live under the "Current Items"
heading as `### <id> <title>` sections. Once an issue has been resolved, remove
its `### <id> <title>` section from Current Items below — but never remove its
row from the Ledger table at the bottom of this file; see "Ledger" below.

Format:
```
### <id> <short title>

A description of what, why it matters, where, and a suggested fix.

```
Where `<id>` is a literal "TD" then the date followed by a zero-padded
sequential number (starting at 1 for the the first entry of a day). I.e.:
**TD*YYMMDDNN***. `NN` is one more than the highest `NN` already used for
that date **in the Ledger table**, not just what's currently visible above
it — a resolved entry's body is removed, but its Ledger row stays forever,
so the Ledger (not memory or scrollback) is the source of truth for the next
free ID. Compute it with `scripts/next-tech-debt-id.pl` rather than counting
by hand.

## Claiming an item

Before starting work on an open item, confirm nobody else already has:
check its Ledger row is `open` (not `in-progress`), and skim open pull
requests for its ID. Then:

1. Flip its Ledger row's Status to `in-progress`.
2. Push a branch and open a **draft** pull request right away — before the
   fix is finished — so `gh pr list` shows it's claimed. The first commit
   can be the Ledger status flip itself.
3. Do the work, pushing further commits to the same branch/PR.
4. Once verified, flip the Ledger row to `resolved` (fill in `Resolved` and
   `Ref`), remove the entry's `### <id>` section from Current Items, and mark
   the PR ready for review.

If a claim is abandoned (the draft PR is closed without merging), flip the
row back to `open`.

## Review provenance

Where an item was filed from a project review's recommendation, record the
mapping here, and add the row when the item is filed — not when it is
resolved. A review's recommendations and this register are two channels onto
the same work, and the autonomous pipeline's Co-Ordinator uses exactly this
cross-reference to tell that they are: it skips a recommendation whose `R-NN`
is named in this file, on the grounds that this curated, status-tracked
channel owns it. Without the mapping it has only one other way to know a
recommendation is done — a merged PR referencing it — so work that landed as a
direct commit reads as outstanding forever, and the recommendation is selected
and re-investigated every cycle.

Only record a mapping once the Ledger item is known to cover the
recommendation's whole *Intended end state*. A recommendation that is broader
than the item mirroring it keeps the remainder in the review channel, where it
is still visible; claiming it here would silently retire work nobody has done.

| Review | Recommendation | Ledger ID |

## Current Items

The open and in-progress items, each as a `### <id> <title>` section. This
heading is permanent: when there are no current items it stays here (empty), so
it is always obvious where a new item's body belongs.

<!-- Add new items directly below, as `### <id> <title>` sections. -->

### TD26071902 Index grid and all-poems listing don't render title inline markup

**What:** A poem's visible title on the single-poem page renders restricted
inline markup — `*em*`/`_em_`, `**strong**`/`__strong__`, `~~strike~~` — via
`titleHtml`, but the index grid (`public/index.html` / `public/index.js`) and
the all-poems listing (`public/all-poems.html`) still show the plain,
unmarked-up title.

**Why:** A title using markup (e.g. `*Fragments* & Unity`) looks inconsistent
between the single-poem page (rendered) and these two aggregate views
(literal asterisks/underscores/tildes), which is a visible authoring surface
poem authors will notice.

**Where:** Deliberately deferred as a non-goal in the title-markup design
(§3, "Rendering markup in the index grid and all-poems listing titles") and
listed as follow-up work in §10 ("Index grid and all-poems listing markup")
of `docs/design/title-inline-markup.md` — since removed from the repo now
that the feature has shipped (see `git show 000b9f4:docs/design/title-inline-markup.md`
to recover it), landed via PR #64 (`feat(render): restricted inline markup in
poem titles`).

**Suggested fix:** Thread `titleHtml` through the JSON data island that
`summarizePoem()` builds in `src/tools/aggregate-render-core.js` (currently
only `title` is included; see the `<script type="application/json"
id="poem-data">` island it feeds) so the client has the rendered markup
available, then:
- `public/index.js` — set the title link's content from `titleHtml` via
  `innerHTML` instead of `link.textContent = poem.title`, matching the
  escape-first, tag-injection-safe construction already used server-side.
- `public/all-poems.html` / its build path in `aggregate-render-core.js` —
  use `titleHtml` in place of the plain title in the table-of-contents row
  and the poem-section heading.

Keep the plain `title` alongside `titleHtml` in the JSON island (needed for
search filtering, `safePoemHref`, alt text, etc.) — this is additive, not a
replacement.

## Ledger

Every tech-debt ID ever allocated — open, in-progress, resolved, or not-debt —
is listed here forever, in ID order. This is what makes numbering unambiguous:
the next free ID for a given date is one more than the highest `NN` seen
below for that date, regardless of whether the corresponding entry still has
a body above.

A row can also close as `not-debt`: the item was filed here but turned out, on
reflection, not to be a deferred cost at all (e.g. deliberately reserved
syntax awaiting a future feature). Its `### <id>` section is removed like a
resolved one, but nothing was fixed, so the `Resolved` column stays blank; the
`Ref` column instead points to wherever the content moved.
