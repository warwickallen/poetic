#
# sync-framework.sh — pull framework files from warwickallen/poetic into this repo.
#
# The poetic framework owns the build tools, templates, editor integrations, and
# documentation.  This script fetches the requested ref from the upstream repo,
# checks out each framework-owned path at that ref, and updates .poetic-version.
#
# Paths listed in skip_paths inside .poetic-config.yaml are left untouched,
# allowing users to maintain local overrides of specific framework files.
#
# This script syncs itself first. If scripts/sync-framework.sh changed upstream
# (e.g. a new path was added to FRAMEWORK_PATHS below), it re-execs the updated
# copy before syncing anything else, so the run picks up the current list
# instead of a stale one.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/sync-framework.sh                  # sync using ref in .poetic-version
#   scripts/sync-framework.sh --ref v1.2.0     # sync from a specific tag
#   scripts/sync-framework.sh --ref main       # sync from latest main
#   scripts/sync-framework.sh --commit         # also commit the staged sync
#
# After running, review staged changes with `git diff --staged`, then commit
# (or pass --commit to have the script commit them with its suggested message).
