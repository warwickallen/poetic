# Changelog

All notable changes to the Poetic framework are recorded here.
Patch-level fixes and routine documentation updates are omitted unless they
affect behaviour visible to poem authors or site publishers.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Restricted title inline markup now also renders on the index grid and
  all-poems listing**, matching the single-poem page. A title using
  `*emphasis*`, `**strong**` or `~~strikethrough~~` previously showed the
  literal markers on these two aggregate views; it now renders the same way
  everywhere. The plain title is still used for search filtering, `<title>`,
  slugs, attributes, `%{title}` and Blogger. See `docs/POEM-SYNTAX.md`.
- **Tech-debt tooling is now multi-repo- and concurrency-aware.**
  `scripts/get-tech-debt-record.pl` and `scripts/next-tech-debt-id.pl` accept
  `--ref <git-ref>` (typically `--ref origin/main` after a fetch) to read
  `TECH-DEBT.md` from the shared repository state instead of a possibly stale
  or wrongly-branched local checkout. The `/td` skill now searches every repo
  attached to the session — a multi-repo workspace resolves an ID segment
  across all of its repos, treating matches as (repo, ID) pairs since sister
  repos allocate from the same date-based ID sequence. Claiming an item now
  uses a deterministic branch name, `td/<id>`, whose creation acts as a
  race-safe lock between concurrent agents; `TECH-DEBT.md`'s "Claiming an
  item" workflow is rewritten accordingly, and the new scripts and skill are
  covered by `test/tech-debt-scripts.test.js`.
- **Regression tests for the two previously-fixed XSS alerts.**
  `test/serve-static.test.js` covers `escapeHtml`/`encodeHref`/
  `generateDirectoryListing` (stored-XSS fix, `3eb8bd9`) with hostile
  filenames and relative paths; `test/public-index.test.js` covers
  `renderPoems`/`appendTitleHtml` (DOM-XSS fix, `8e4d6ac`) with a hostile
  poem title and label, asserting the hostile string only ever reaches the
  DOM as inert text. Both fixes were previously verified manually only.
  Resolves TD26072106.

### Changed

- **Minimum supported Node.js version raised from 18 to 22**, matching the
  version CI already builds and tests against. `package.json`'s
  `engines.node` is now `>=22`, `.npmrc` sets `engine-strict=true` so
  `npm install`/`npm ci` refuse an older runtime outright, and the README's
  prerequisite line now reads "Node.js 22.x". Both Node 18 and Node 20 are
  past end-of-life. Resolves TD26072107.

### Fixed

- **`scripts/get-tech-debt-record.pl` now matches an ID segment against the
  end of a record ID only** (`TD26070803` is matched by `3`, `803` or the full
  ID), as the `/td` skill intends. Previously the segment could match anywhere
  inside the ID, so a short segment like `708` could ambiguously match many
  records from the same day. The skill documentation's examples are updated to
  match.
- **The postscript "See more" toggle is now keyboard-operable.** It was a
  `display: none` checkbox + `<label>`, which cannot receive keyboard focus
  (WCAG 2.1.1). It's now a real `<button aria-expanded>` wired via
  `addEventListener` in `public/poetic.js`, mirroring the sort-header fix in
  `all-poems.html`. Mouse behaviour and visual styling are unchanged.

## [6.1.1] — 2026-07-19

### Changed

- **Strikethrough is now `~~text~~` (double tilde), matching Markdown
  convention — was `~text~`.** This applies to both the poem-body WYSIWYG
  dialect and the restricted title-markup subset added in v6.1.0. A single `~`
  is now plain literal text, deliberately left unassigned and reserved for a
  possible future subscript syntax; `\~` still escapes to a literal `~` (e.g.
  `\~\~` for two adjacent literal tildes that should not read as a `~~` pair).
  Unmatched `~~` remains literal, consistent with the existing unmatched-pair
  rule, and `~~…~~` pairs match across lines within a paragraph but not across
  paragraph boundaries, exactly like `**…**`. No poem in this repo's corpus
  used single-tilde strikethrough except the canonical example fixture
  (`_example.poem`), which is updated here. See `docs/POEM-SYNTAX.md`.

## [6.1.0] — 2026-07-19

### Added

- **Restricted inline markup in poem titles.** A poem's visible heading now
  renders emphasis (`*word*` / `_word_`), strong (`**word**` / `__word__`) and
  strikethrough (`~word~`); escape a literal marker with `\* \_ \~ \\`. Only
  these three forms are supported — no links, spans, smart quotes, dashes,
  entities or raw HTML — and rendering is escape-first, so a title can never
  inject a tag. The plain title is unchanged and still used everywhere else
  (`<title>`, slugs, Open Graph, attributes, `%{title}`, Blogger, and the index
  / all-poems listings). Existing titles are byte-stable. See
  `docs/POEM-SYNTAX.md`.
- **Browser-safe renderer (`src/browser/render.js`).** `renderPoem(text, opts)`
  and `renderPoemPage(text, opts)` render a `.poem` to HTML in a plain JS
  runtime — no filesystem, `__dirname`, or Pug compiler — so a web app can share
  the framework's exact renderer instead of forking it. Their output is
  byte-for-byte identical to the CLI build. Supporting this, the Pug templates
  are precompiled to `src/tools/poem-templates.js` and the builtin song handlers
  to `src/tools/song-handlers-data.js` (both generated by `npm run build:generated`
  and guarded by freshness tests), and `song-handlers.js`/`slugify.js` are now
  filesystem-free. The renderer output is unsanitised by design — see
  `docs/RENDERER-BROWSER.md` for the API and the consumer-side sanitisation
  requirement. `package.json` now declares an `exports` map (`poetic/browser`,
  `poetic/browser/poetic.css`) so a consumer app can `npm install
  github:Poetic-Poems/poetic#<tag>` and import the renderer plus the preview
  CSS at a pinned version, without publishing this (still-`private`) package
  to npm — see "Packaging & consumption" in `docs/RENDERER-BROWSER.md`.
- **Browser-safe aggregate renderers (`src/browser/render-aggregate.js`).**
  `renderAllPoems(poems, opts)` and `renderIndex(poems, opts)` render the
  all-poems/index pages from an in-memory list of poems — no filesystem — the
  aggregate counterpart to `renderPoem`/`renderPoemPage`. Both are exported
  from `poetic/browser` alongside the single-poem renderer. Supporting this,
  `src/tools/aggregate-render-core.js` is a new pure, filesystem-free templating
  module shared with the CLI build's `build-all-poems.js`, so the Node and
  browser aggregate outputs cannot silently diverge. See "Aggregate renderers"
  in `docs/RENDERER-BROWSER.md`.
- **`scripts/new-poem TITLE`.** Scaffolds a new `.poem` file (kebab-cased
  filename, today's date, one empty stanza), opens it in the users' default
  editor (dafaults to vi), and builds — a one-command alternative to copying
  `_example.poem` by hand for the common case of starting a poem from scratch.

### Changed

- **Blogger auth failures now say what to do about them.** Google's API
  answers a permissions problem with a bare "The caller does not have
  permission", naming neither the account nor the blog, so the commonest setup
  mistake — authorising as a Google account that does not own the blog —
  surfaced as an error with nothing to act on. `npm run sync:blogger` now
  prints guidance beneath any failure it recognises: a 403 asks Blogger which
  blogs the authorised account *can* reach and reports the mismatch, and
  `invalid_grant`, `invalid_client`, and a 404 on the blog each get their
  likely cause and fix. `npm run blogger:auth` now shows Google's account
  chooser rather than silently using whichever account the browser is signed in
  to, and lists the blogs the chosen account can manage — marking the one that
  matches `blogger.blog_id` — before it offers to save anything, so a wrong
  account is caught at authorisation instead of at the next sync.
  `docs/BLOGGER.md` gains a Troubleshooting section covering these, the 7-day
  refresh-token expiry that an unpublished OAuth consent screen causes, and the
  two separate places credentials live.

### Fixed

- **All-poems page no longer breaks on titles containing `<`, `&`, or `"`.**
  The table-of-contents row and the poem-section heading in
  `src/tools/aggregate-render-core.js` interpolated each poem's title into
  raw HTML unescaped, unlike the single-poem view (which escapes it via
  Pug's `=`). A title containing those characters could break the surrounding
  markup or inject HTML on the all-poems page. Both sites now HTML-escape the
  title, matching the single-poem view.
- **`blogger-auth` can overwrite a read-only credentials file.** Saving the
  minted token used `fs.writeFileSync(CREDENTIALS_FILE, …, { mode: 0o600 })`;
  the `mode` option only applies when a file is created, so against an
  existing, deliberately read-only (`0400`) `.blogger-credentials.json` the
  write failed with `EACCES: permission denied` — after the browser OAuth
  consent step had already completed. The save now writes to a temp file
  (mode `0600`) and atomically renames it over the target, so existing
  permissions on the target can't block the write; the resulting file is
  always mode `0600`.
- **`renderPoem()`'s fragment now shows the poem's title.** `public/poetic.css`
  hides the fragment's inline `.poem-info .title` span unconditionally,
  because every other caller of the shared fragment template (single-poem
  pages, `all-poems.html`) already renders its own visible `h2.poem-title`
  heading around the fragment. `renderPoem()` — used directly for a live
  preview, e.g. Poetic Fiddle's editor, with no such wrapping heading — left
  the title with no visible representation at all: a blank line where the
  title should be. `renderPoem()` (and `renderFragment()`, for symmetry) now
  accepts a `standalone` option, defaulting to `true` for `renderPoem()`, that
  includes a visible `h2.poem-title` heading in the fragment; existing callers
  that already supply their own heading are unaffected. See "API" in
  `docs/RENDERER-BROWSER.md`.
- **Blogger themes build again.** `public/poetic.css` described HTML elements
  in its comments as `<button>`, `<th>` and `<a>`, and used `<service>` as a
  placeholder. `build-blogger.js` injects that CSS into the theme's `b:skin`
  block, and Blogger scans the whole block — comments included — for skin
  variable declarations, so those seven fragments arrived as unclosed elements
  and Blogger rejected the theme on save with "Invalid variable declaration in
  page skin: ... not well-formed", naming no file or line. The comments now
  name elements in prose and write placeholders in braces
  (`.song-embed--{service}`); no rule changed. `build-blogger.js` now fails the
  build with the offending file and line if tag-shaped text appears in
  `poetic.css` or a consumer's `custom.css`, rather than writing a theme
  Blogger will refuse.
- **`convertMarkup()`'s escape restoration is no longer quadratic in the number
  of escapes.** It restored each escaped character with its own
  `String.prototype.replace()` call inside a loop over the escapes `Map`, and
  each call rescanned the whole placeholder-laden string from the start —
  O(N²) overall for N escapes (empirically ~900ms for 50,000 escapes; tens of
  seconds projected for 200,000). Restoration now runs in a single global-regex
  pass over the text, so it's linear regardless of input size. No change to
  the restored content.
- **`Sync framework from poetic` no longer fails outright when the sync touches
  a workflow file.** The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` can never push changes to
  `.github/workflows/*.yml` (a GitHub restriction, not a permissions
  misconfiguration), so any sync that updated one of the framework's own
  workflow files failed to open its PR. The workflow now uses an optional
  `SYNC_PAT` repository secret (a PAT with the `workflow` scope) when present,
  falling back to `GITHUB_TOKEN` otherwise — see "Automatic framework sync" in
  `docs/BUILD.md` for setup.
- **`poem-syntax.ebnf`'s preamble grammar now derives comment blocks.** The
  `preamble_item` production references `comment_block`, and the "comment
  blocks can appear anywhere" allowance is now backed by a documented lexical
  pre-pass rule instead of prose alone — matching `docs/POEM-SYNTAX.md` §0 and
  the parser's existing behaviour. No parsing behaviour changes.

### Security

- **`poem-parser.js`'s line-continuation folding no longer risks catastrophic
  regex backtracking.** `joinContinuedLines()` located a trailing backslash
  run with `/(\\+)(\r?)$/`, which can backtrack polynomially on a long
  backslash run that turns out not to be anchored at the string end (CodeQL
  `js/polynomial-redos`, high severity) — a `.poem` body line with many
  thousands of trailing backslashes could hang the parser. The trailing run
  is now located with a plain backward character scan instead of a regex, so
  matching is linear regardless of input.
- **`blogger-auth.js` no longer echoes credentials in its "Next steps" summary.**
  The closing summary reprinted `BLOGGER_CLIENT_ID`, `BLOGGER_CLIENT_SECRET`, and
  `BLOGGER_REFRESH_TOKEN` in plain text (CodeQL `js/clear-text-logging`, high
  severity) — a redundant echo, since the client ID/secret were entered by the
  operator and the refresh token was already shown once in the SUCCESS banner
  above. The summary now prints `<redacted>` placeholders instead.
- **`poem-parser.js`'s audio (song-service) line matching no longer risks
  catastrophic regex backtracking.** `parseAudio()` located a service name,
  optional value, and optional trailing `(...)` param list with
  `/^([A-Za-z][\w-]*)\s*(?::\s*(.*?))?(?:\s+(\(.*\)))?$/`, whose lazy value
  capture and optional trailing group overlap, so an audio line that
  repeatedly looks like it might open a param list but never closes one
  could backtrack polynomially (CodeQL `js/polynomial-redos`, high
  severity) — ~4.2s for a 100,000-char adversarial input. The line is now
  matched with a linear character scan instead, so matching is linear
  regardless of input.
- **`poem-parser.js`'s directive-line, label-line, and reserved-`\?`-escape
  matching no longer risk catastrophic regex backtracking.** `parseDirectiveLine()`,
  the Metadata section's label matching, and `convertMarkup()`'s `\?`
  reserved-escape check used
  `/^\s*%([\w.-]+)((?:\s+[\w.]+:[\w.-]+)*)(\s+#.*)?\s*$/i`,
  `/^\s*#([^&<>\\#\s]+?)(\s+#.*)?\s*$/i`, and the unanchored `/(\\+)\?/g`
  respectively (CodeQL `js/polynomial-redos`, high severity, alerts 11-13) —
  the last of these backtracks polynomially on a long backslash run with no
  `?` anywhere in it (~33s for a 200,000-backslash input). All three are now
  matched with a linear character scan instead, so matching is linear
  regardless of input.
- **`poem-to-raw.js`'s tag-stripping now runs to a fixed point.** `htmlToPlainText`
  previously ran its `<br>`/block-close/tag-strip replacements in a single pass,
  so a crafted nested sequence (e.g. `<scr<script>ipt>`) could have its inner
  tag stripped while reconstituting the outer one, leaving a literal `<script>`
  in the "sanitised" plain-text output (CodeQL `js/incomplete-multi-character-sanitization`,
  high severity). The replacements now loop until the string stops changing.
- **`public/index.js`'s poem card rendering no longer builds HTML via
  `innerHTML` template literals.** `renderPoems()` interpolated `poem.title`
  and `poem.labels` values directly into an `innerHTML` string, so a crafted
  title or label could inject arbitrary HTML/JavaScript into the page
  (CodeQL `js/xss-through-dom`, high severity). Poem cards are now built with
  `createElement`/`textContent`/`appendChild`, so poem data is never parsed
  as HTML. `poem.file` is also validated by a new `safePoemHref()` allowlist
  before it's assigned to an anchor's `href` or `window.location.href`, so a
  scheme (e.g. `javascript:`) or a protocol-relative `//host` can't be used
  as a navigation target.
- **`serve-static.js`'s generated directory listing no longer interpolates
  filenames and the requested path into HTML unescaped.** `generateDirectoryListing()`
  built each entry's link and the page's title/path directly from
  `fs.readdirSync` filenames and the request path, so a file or directory
  named with HTML markup would have that markup execute in the browser of
  anyone who viewed the listing (CodeQL `js/stored-xss`, high severity).
  Entry names and the current path are now HTML-escaped before insertion,
  and `href`s are built from percent-encoded path segments so a crafted name
  can't break out of the attribute or be read as a URI scheme.
- **`sync-blogger.test.js`'s Suno-link-removal assertion no longer relies on a
  raw substring check.** The test asserted `!result.includes('suno.com')` to
  confirm the Suno anchor was stripped, but a substring check like this would
  also incorrectly pass a crafted `href` such as `https://suno.com.evil.example`
  (CodeQL `js/incomplete-url-substring-sanitization`, high severity). The
  assertion now extracts each remaining `href` and compares its parsed
  hostname exactly against `suno.com`.
- **`yaml-to-poem.js`'s entity decoding no longer double-decodes reconstituted
  entities.** `convertEntitiesToMarkup` decoded `&#38;` (the numeric entity for
  `&`) partway through its pass, so the `&` it produced could combine with
  leftover text into a fresh entity-shaped sequence that a still-pending replace
  then decoded a second time — e.g. the literal text `&#38;#8220;` (an author
  writing about an HTML entity) became a curly quote that was never in the
  source (CodeQL `js/double-escaping`, high severity). `&#38;` now decodes
  strictly last, after every other entity pattern has run, so no earlier replace
  can ever see its output — a single, deterministic, non-overlapping pass.
- **`song-handlers.js`'s `deepMerge`/`loadSongHandlers` no longer risk
  prototype pollution.** Both the handler-name loop in `loadSongHandlers` and
  the recursive `deepMerge` copied keys straight from a `song_handlers`
  config without guarding against `__proto__`/`constructor`/`prototype`
  (CodeQL `js/prototype-pollution-utility`, medium severity) — a
  `.poetic-config.yaml` with a `song_handlers.__proto__` (or a nested
  handler's `__proto__`/`constructor`) key could write properties directly
  onto the live `Object.prototype`, affecting every object in the process.
  Both loops now skip these key names outright via a direct `key === '__proto__'
  || key === 'constructor' || key === 'prototype'` equality check — CodeQL's
  guard recognition for this query only treats an inline equality test as a
  sanitizing barrier, not an indirect membership check (e.g. a `Set`/array
  lookup), so the alert stayed open under an earlier version of this fix that
  blocked the same keys via `Set.has()`.

## [6.0.0] — 2026-07-12

## [6.0.1] — 2026-07-13

### Added

- **Browser-safe aggregate renderers.** `renderAllPoems(poems, opts)` and
  `renderIndex(poems, opts)` provide browser-safe aggregate rendering
  (commit 81f8ce7).
- **Expose browser renderer via `package.json` exports.** Consumers can now
  import the browser renderer and preview CSS from the package exports
  (commit c541ae2).
- **`scripts/new-poem` command.** Scaffolds a new `.poem` file and opens it in
  the user's editor (commit 3ad2c5d).
- **`LICENCE-POEMS.md` added** (commit 115b153).

### Fixed

- **`sync-framework.sh` workflow pushes.** Use of an optional `SYNC_PAT`
  avoids failing PRs when workflow files are updated (commit 0ca7c9f).

### Documentation

- Miscellaneous documentation and housekeeping updates (commits 67e9487,
  8ca7c7f, bc2c8c2).


### Added

- **Line continuation with a trailing backslash.** A line ending in a backslash
  immediately before the newline (no trailing whitespace) is joined to the next
  line, so a long title, label, audio embed, or parameter list can be split
  across several physical lines. Two trailing backslashes (`\\`) produce one
  literal backslash and keep the newline; the rule chains for longer runs. It
  applies throughout a poem's own line syntax but not inside raw `<<<...>>>`
  literal or `<<<markdown>>>` blocks, whose content is passed through verbatim.
  (Continuation only removes the newline — a parameter list split across lines
  still needs its commas.)
- **`\?` is now reserved.** The escape prefix `\?` raises a build error, keeping
  it free for a future extended-escape family; write `\\?` for a literal
  backslash followed by `?`.
- **Breaking: directives may now be declared in the Preamble.** A directive
  line (`%name key:value …`) may appear before the header, as well as in the
  Metadata section, so a directive that changes how the rest of the poem is
  parsed can be seen early, before the content it affects. When directives
  are declared in both places, they are collected into one `directives` list
  in source order — Preamble directives first, then Metadata directives —
  and are not de-duplicated. Because the preamble is now scanned for
  directives, a poem whose title previously began with an unescaped `%`
  (e.g. `%Intro`) is now silently parsed as a Preamble directive instead of
  a title line, shifting the header down by one line — use the new `\%`
  escape (below) to keep a literal `%` at the start of a title.
- **`\%` is a new escaped character.** `\%` decodes to a literal `%` in the
  poem body, labels, and the title, so a title may start with `%` (e.g.
  `\%Intro` → title `%Intro`) without its line being read as a Preamble
  directive. `\%{…}` is unchanged: it remains the render-time
  context-variable literal escape.

### Fixed

- **Incremental rebuilds now track a poem's real `$ref` dependencies and
  detect poems added or removed reliably.** The build's staleness check no
  longer assumes a poem's `$ref` targets are underscore-prefixed partials in
  the same directory — it follows each poem's actual (transitive) `$ref`
  targets, so editing a referenced file — including one that is not
  underscore-prefixed or lives in a subdirectory — now correctly rebuilds the
  poems that reference it. The aggregate pages (`index.html`, `all-poems.html`,
  and the raw index) no longer rely on the source directory's own mtime to
  notice a poem being added or removed; they compare a recorded manifest of
  the source set instead, so additions and removals are detected on every
  filesystem and sync tool. Both were previously best-effort approximations
  that could skip a needed rebuild.
- **Doc-only pull requests no longer hang on the required `build` check.**
  `build-poems.yml`'s `build` job is a required status check, but the
  workflow only triggered on its `paths:` list, so a PR touching only e.g.
  `CLAUDE.md` or `SECURITY.md` never produced a `build` check at all — the
  required check sat as "Expected" indefinitely, blocking merge for anyone
  without bypass permission. The `build` job now triggers on every push/PR
  to `main` unconditionally and always reports a real status, but skips its
  install/test/lint/build/deploy steps whenever an internal changed-files
  check finds nothing under its build-relevant path list changed, per
  GitHub's documented workaround for required checks gated by `paths:`.
- **`sync-blogger.js` now finds `.yml` poems and excludes `YAML-SCHEMA*`.**
  The "list poem YAML files" filter (accept `.yaml`/`.yml`, exclude
  `YAML-SCHEMA*` and `_`-prefixed files) was duplicated across
  `build-poems.js`, `build-all-poems.js` (twice), and `sync-blogger.js`, and
  had diverged in `sync-blogger.js`: it only matched `.yaml` and did not
  exclude `YAML-SCHEMA*`. All four call sites now share one
  `listPoemYamlFiles()` helper in `poem-render.js`. This changes
  `sync-blogger.js` behaviour: a poem source saved as `.yml` now syncs to
  Blogger like any `.yaml` poem, and a `YAML-SCHEMA.yaml`/`YAML-SCHEMA.yml`
  file (if present in `src/poems/yaml/`) is no longer sent to Blogger as a
  post.
- **`sync-blogger.js` now anchors on the repo root, not the invoking shell's
  working directory.** `YAML_DIR` and the `.poetic-config.yaml` lookup were
  built from `process.cwd()`, so running the script from any directory other
  than the repo root resolved the wrong paths — every other build tool
  anchors on `REPO_ROOT` (`src/tools/repo-root.js`) for this reason.
  `sync-blogger.js` now does the same.
- **`sync-framework.sh` now syncs `package-lock.json`.** The framework-owned
  paths list copied `package.json` but not the lockfile, so a dependency bump
  upstream (e.g. `js-beautify` 1.x → 2.x) reached consumers as a
  `package.json` change with a stale `package-lock.json`, and their CI failed
  at `npm ci` with "can only install packages when your package.json and
  package-lock.json … are in sync". Both files now sync together.

- **`sync-blogger.js` now reads credentials saved by `blogger-auth.js`.**
  `blogger-auth.js` saves `.blogger-credentials.json` with top-level keys
  (`client_id`, `client_secret`, `refresh_token`); `sync-blogger.js` only read
  the nested Google client-secrets `installed` shape, so a file saved by the
  auth helper was silently ignored and sync reported "missing environment
  variable(s)" with the file sitting right there. `resolveConfig` now accepts
  either shape (top-level keys win if both are present) and returns the
  resolved credentials directly instead of writing them to module-level
  variables; the missing-credentials message now also mentions the
  credentials file. `blogger-auth.js` now writes the credentials file with
  mode `0600`, since it holds a refresh token with full blog write access.
- **Build failures no longer degrade silently.** Several failure paths used
  to log a message and let the pipeline exit 0, publishing a degraded site:
  a `.poem` that failed conversion during `poem-to-yaml.js --all` simply
  disappeared from the build; a poem that failed to render into
  `all-poems.html` had `Error rendering poem: <message>` embedded in the
  published page instead of failing the build; a failed `index.html`
  regeneration logged "Skipped index.html update due to errors" and still
  exited 0; and a `$ref` cycle in a poem's YAML crashed `resolveRefs` with an
  unhelpful stack-overflow `RangeError`. All four now fail the build:
  conversion and render errors are counted and reported, then the process
  exits non-zero; `$ref` cycles are detected and raise a clear error naming
  the referencing file and the cycle instead of recursing forever. Site
  publishers now see CI fail instead of a partially-broken site deploying.
- **`all-poems.html`'s table-of-contents column headers are keyboard- and
  screen-reader-accessible.** Each sortable header's click handler was a bare
  `onclick="sortTable(...)"` on the `<th>` itself, with no `tabindex`, key
  handling, or `aria-sort` — keyboard and screen-reader users could not sort
  the poem table. Each `<th class="sortable">` now wraps a real `<button>`
  (native Tab focus and Enter/Space activation, wired via `addEventListener`
  in `public/all-poems.js` instead of inline `onclick`), and the active
  column's `<th>` now carries `aria-sort="ascending"`/`"descending"`
  (`"none"` otherwise), updated on every sort. Mouse behaviour, the visual
  sort indicators (↕/↑/↓), and header styling are unchanged.

### Added

- **Incremental (mtime-based) rebuilds.** `poem-to-raw`, `build:yaml`,
  `build:poems`, and the `all-poems.html`/`index.html` step each skip
  regenerating an output whose sources (the poem file itself, plus shared
  inputs like `.shared.poem`, underscore-prefixed YAML partials, the Pug
  templates, `.poetic-config.yaml`, `src/song-handlers.yaml`, and the footer
  source) haven't changed since it was last built, via a shared
  `src/tools/needs-rebuild.js` helper. Pass `--force` (or set
  `POETIC_FORCE_REBUILD=1`) to force a full rebuild regardless of
  modification times. `scripts/sync-framework.sh` also now skips checking out
  a framework-owned path whose content already matches the target commit, so
  a no-op sync doesn't bump every file's modification time and defeat this
  optimisation on the next build. See [Incremental
  rebuilds](docs/BUILD.md#incremental-rebuilds) in `docs/BUILD.md`.
- **Configurable site title.** A new top-level `title` key in
  `.poetic-config.yaml` sets the `<title>` and `<h1>` shown on `index.html`
  and `all-poems.html` (default: `My Poems`). Previously the framework's own
  site name was hard-coded into the generators. See
  [Title](docs/BUILD.md#title) in `docs/BUILD.md`. Resolves TD26071102.
- **MIT licence.** A `LICENCE` file now covers the repo, `package.json`'s
  `license` field matches it, and the file syncs to consumers. Resolves
  TD26071101.
- **Complete `package.json` metadata.** Added `name`, `version`, `license`,
  `engines` (`node >= 18`), and `private`. The `version` field is now the
  single source of truth for releases: bumping it in a commit to `main`
  causes `.github/workflows/release.yml` to tag that commit and publish the
  GitHub release automatically, so the tag can't drift out of sync with
  `package.json`. See the "Release process" section in `CLAUDE.md`. Resolves
  TD26071106.
- **Per-handler embed permission override.** A custom song handler can set
  `embed_allow` and/or `embed_allowfullscreen` to override the `allow` /
  `allowfullscreen` attributes `poetic.js` puts on that handler's lazy-loaded
  iframe. Left unset, the handler's embeds keep using the framework's global
  default (`autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; encrypted-media` +
  `allowfullscreen`). See [Embed permissions](docs/BUILD.md#embed-permissions)
  in `docs/BUILD.md`. Resolves TD26071002.
- **ESLint (flat config) as the project's first devDependency, plus
  `.editorconfig`.** `eslint.config.js` lints the CommonJS Node sources
  (`src/tools/`, `test/`, `scripts/`) and the browser scripts (`public/*.js`)
  separately, each with the right globals, starting from `@eslint/js`'s
  recommended rules relaxed to match existing style rather than restyling
  the codebase: console is allowed (these are CLI tools and browser
  scripts); `eqeqeq` is scoped to `"smart"` so the established `x != null`
  idiom still passes; `no-constant-condition` ignores loops, for the
  `while (true) { ... break; }` idiom used in `poem-to-yaml.js`; and
  `no-unused-vars` ignores `_`-prefixed names, matching the existing
  "deliberately discarded" convention (e.g. `catch (_)`). `npm run lint`
  runs it; CI runs it in `build-poems.yml` alongside the trailing-whitespace
  check. Fixed the real findings it surfaced — dead code, unused
  variables/labels, and useless regex escapes in `poem-to-yaml.js`,
  `sync-blogger.js`, `song-handlers.js`, `all-poems.js`, and two test files —
  and removed the vestigial `eslint-disable-next-line no-console` comments in
  `serve-static.js`, which referenced a rule that wasn't installed and is now
  allowed outright. `.editorconfig` documents the same 2-space/LF/final-
  newline/trim-trailing-whitespace convention `npm run check` already
  enforces, opting `.poem` and `.md` files out of trailing-whitespace
  trimming since both have meaningful trailing whitespace (a forced line
  break, and a Markdown hard break, respectively). Both files are added to
  `FRAMEWORK_PATHS` in `sync-framework.sh` and sync to consumers — they
  already receive `src/tools/` and `test/`, so linting there is coherent,
  and the devDependency reaches them automatically via the already-synced
  `package.json`.
- **CI backstop for Conventional Commits.** A new
  `.github/workflows/commit-format.yml` runs on every pull request —
  unfiltered by path, since commit hygiene isn't specific to any one part of
  the tree — and validates every commit's subject line, so the check now
  applies even when a contributor's clone never enabled the opt-in local
  hook (`git config core.hooksPath .githooks`). The Conventional Commits
  pattern is extracted from `.githooks/commit-msg` into
  `.githooks/check-commit-format.sh`, shared by both the hook and the new CI
  job so there is one source of truth for the regex. Not synced to
  consumers: Conventional Commits is this repo's own convention (see
  the "Commit messages" section of `README.md`), not one imposed on poem-
  collection repos. Resolves TD26071108.
- **`main` is now a protected, squash-merge-only branch.** The GitHub repo
  settings disallow direct commits/pushes to `main` and only allow squash
  merging, so every change — including releases — goes through a pull
  request. A squash merge folds the branch onto a single commit whose
  subject defaults to the PR title, not any individual branch commit, so
  `.github/workflows/commit-format.yml` now also validates the PR title
  against Conventional Commits (it previously only checked each branch
  commit). `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md` document the new branch workflow and
  the pull-request-based release process.
- **CodeQL security scanning.** A new `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` runs
  GitHub's CodeQL analysis on every pull request and push to `main`, plus a
  weekly schedule, covering `javascript-typescript` (the build tools in
  `src/tools/`) and `actions` (this repo's own workflow YAML). Results upload
  to the repo's Security tab.

### Changed

- **`js-yaml` upgraded to v5.** The build tools use only `yaml.load` /
  `yaml.dump`, both of which are unchanged in v5, and generated poem YAML for
  real four-digit poem dates is byte-for-byte identical to v4. v5 narrows its
  timestamp-detection regex, so a non-standard placeholder date whose year is
  `0000` (e.g. `0000-01-01`) is now dumped unquoted (`date: 0000-01-01`) rather
  than quoted (`date: '0000-01-01'`); it still round-trips back to the identical
  string, and no real poem date is affected. Resolves TD26071109.
- **`scripts/sync-framework.sh` now propagates upstream deletions.** Previously
  the script only overlaid framework files (`git checkout <commit> -- <path>`),
  so a file the framework *removed* upstream lived on in every consumer repo
  forever. After the checkout pass it now stages a removal for each
  framework-owned path deleted between the previously synced commit and the
  target commit (`git diff --diff-filter=D`), announced with a `deleted …`
  line alongside the existing `synced`/`skipped` output. Deletion is
  conservative — a path is removed only when it is under the framework path
  list, was deleted upstream between the two synced commits, and is not in
  `skip_paths`; a path merely absent at the target commit (e.g. a consumer's
  own file under a shared framework directory) is never touched. On a first
  sync, or when the previously synced commit is unavailable locally (rewritten
  history), deletion is skipped and the run says so. Resolves TD26071107.

- **`all-poems.html`/`index.html` client-side JS moved to `public/` assets.**
  The sort/filter script for `all-poems.html` and the poem-grid renderer for
  `index.html` used to be generated as large inline `<script>` blobs by
  `build-all-poems.js`. They now live in `public/all-poems.js` and
  `public/index.js`, loaded via `<script src>` like `poetic.js`. `index.html`
  carries its poem list as a `<script type="application/json" id="poem-data">`
  data island that `index.js` reads at runtime, instead of an interpolated
  `const allPoems = [...]` literal; a previously-built `index.html` still
  carrying the old inline format is migrated to the new one automatically on
  its next build. `date-utils.js` is now dependency-free enough to load
  directly as a browser `<script>` as well as a Node module — it's copied
  verbatim to `public/date-utils.js` at build time (single source of truth,
  no hand-maintained second copy), and `all-poems.js` calls its
  `parseDateForSorting()` for the sortable date column instead of carrying a
  duplicate implementation. `build-poems.js` and `build-all-poems.js` also
  gained direct tests. Resolves TD26071105.
- **`js-beautify` upgraded to 2.x.** Verified byte-for-byte identical HTML
  output against 1.15.4 for this framework's beautify options before landing
  the bump; publishers should not see any formatting change in generated
  poem pages.
- **Dev server binds to localhost by default.** `serve-static.js`
  (`npm start` / `npm run build:all`) now listens on `127.0.0.1` instead of
  all interfaces, so the local preview is no longer reachable from other
  machines on your network. `http://localhost:8080` continues to work exactly
  as before. Pass `--host 0.0.0.0` (or set `HOST=0.0.0.0`) to expose it on
  your LAN for the occasional cross-device test.

### Removed

- **Two dead one-off migration tools.** `src/tools/convert-html-to-yaml.js`
  and `src/tools/update-analysis-format.js` were single-use scripts anchored on
  a `poems/` directory layout the framework no longer uses (poems live under
  `src/poems/poem/`); the latter's own comment noted it "was used to migrate
  existing YAML files". They are deleted, and — now that `sync-framework.sh`
  propagates upstream deletions — consumers stop carrying them on their next
  sync.

### Security

- **Tightened dev-server path containment.** The traversal guards in
  `serve-static.js` now compare the resolved path against the served root plus
  a path separator, so a sibling directory whose name merely extends the root
  (e.g. `publicX` beside `public`) can no longer satisfy the check. The
  join/containment logic is factored into `src/tools/path-guard.js` and unit
  tested.
- **Blogger auth flow now uses OAuth `state` and PKCE.** `blogger-auth.js`
  sends a random `state` value plus an S256 PKCE challenge on the consent URL
  and rejects the loopback callback if the returned `state` does not match,
  following RFC 8252 for native-app OAuth.

## [5.1.0] — 2026-07-10

### Added

- **Song-handler value overrides and pasted-URL inference.** A poem's audio
  line can now override just part of a builtin handler's URL — e.g.
  `Audiomack: my-shepherd` overrides only the song slug (useful when a poem's
  URL slug and its Audiomack slug have diverged, such as after disambiguating
  two same-titled poems by filename), and `Audiomack: other_account/song/my-shepherd`
  overrides the artist too. All three builtins (`audiomack`, `suno`, `mega`)
  also accept a full or partial pasted URL from the service itself and infer
  the rest; `suno` additionally infers the `s/` vs `song/` link form from a
  bare ID's shape. This is driven by a new declarative `value_patterns` field
  a custom handler can also use — see [Value
  patterns](docs/BUILD.md#value-patterns) in `docs/BUILD.md`. Resolves
  TD26071001.

### Changed

- **Breaking: `.poetic-config.yaml` is now hierarchical.** Related keys are
  grouped under a parent key instead of sharing a flat `foo_bar` prefix, and
  the Audiomack artist slug moved from a standalone key to a field on its own
  handler (any handler can now take config the same way). `favicon`,
  `subtitle`, and `skip_paths` are unchanged, at the top level. Update your
  `.poetic-config.yaml` by hand — there is no auto-migration. See
  `examples/poetic-config.example.yaml` for a fully-commented reference of
  every key in the new shape.

  | Old (flat) key | New (nested) key |
  |---|---|
  | `auto_sync` | `auto_sync.enabled` |
  | `sync_schedule` | `auto_sync.schedule` |
  | `show_footer` | `footer.enabled` |
  | `footer_source` | `footer.source` |
  | `blogger_sync` | `blogger.sync` |
  | `blogger_blog_id` | `blogger.blog_id` |
  | `blogger_removed` | `blogger.removed` |
  | `blogger_content` | `blogger.content` |
  | `blogger_label` | `blogger.label` |
  | `blogger_template` | `blogger.template` |
  | `audiomack_artist` | `song_handlers.audiomack.artist` |

  The `{audiomack_artist}` token in a custom `song_handlers` URL template is
  now `{artist}` — any scalar field set on a handler (built-in or overridden)
  is available as a token under its own name, not just top-level config keys.

### Added

- **MEGA.nz builtin song handler (`Mega:`).** A public MEGA file link (its
  `<id>#<key>` identifier) becomes an inline, lazy-loaded player that plays
  **both audio and video** files, with full-screen and picture-in-picture, on
  GitHub Pages and Blogger.
- **Configurable player size — per handler and per song.** Handlers declare a
  size with `embed_height` / `embed_aspect_ratio`, or, for multi-media handlers,
  `default_media` + a `media_sizes` map of per-type profiles. Authors override
  it per song with a trailing param list on the audio line —
  `(audio|video)`, `(ratio=16/9)` (also `16:9`), `(height=360)`, or a
  combination such as `(video, ratio=21:9)`. This replaces the previously
  hard-coded Audiomack player height.
- **Deep-merge overrides for song handlers.** A consumer `song_handlers` entry
  now merges into a builtin key-by-key (nested maps like `media_sizes` merge
  recursively; a `null` value deletes a key), so a consumer can retune one size
  profile without redeclaring the handler's `embed_url`.
- **Embed iframes grant full-screen / picture-in-picture.** Lazy-loaded player
  iframes are created with `allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture;
  encrypted-media"` and `allowfullscreen`.

### Fixed

- **`scripts/sync-framework.sh` now handles an empty `skip_paths` list safely.**
  When `.poetic-config.yaml` omits `skip_paths`, the script returns cleanly on
  older Bash versions instead of failing while iterating the empty `SKIP_PATHS`
  array under `set -u`.

- **Vim syntax highlighting of the poem title and the final analysis marker.**
  The title (`poemTitle`) was hard-coded to highlight line 1, so a poem with a
  preamble comment block or variable definitions before the header had its
  title highlighting land on the wrong line (and stole that line from the
  comment/variable-definition highlighting). It now matches the actual title —
  the first line of the header after the optional preamble — located by the
  grammar rather than a fixed line number. Separately, the `====` marker that
  closes the analysis section now splits into the marker and its trailing
  `# comment` (`poemEndMarkerMark` + `poemEndMarkerLineTrailing`), matching how
  every other `====  # comment` line is highlighted. Both are editor-cosmetic
  (no effect on build output).

## [4.3.1] — 2026-07-08

### Fixed

- **Spurious awk warning during `scripts/sync-framework.sh`.** The
  `skip_paths` parser in `.poetic-config.yaml` used a bracket regex
  (`[\"'"'"']`) with an unnecessary backslash before the double quote, which
  awk doesn't recognize as a valid escape inside a character class. Every
  sync run printed `awk: cmd. line:5: warning: regexp escape sequence '\"'
  is not a known regexp operator` to stderr even though quote-stripping still
  worked correctly. The backslash is removed; behaviour is unchanged, only
  the warning is gone.

## [4.3.0] — 2026-07-08

### Added

- **Commit body summary for `scripts/sync-framework.sh --commit`.** The
  auto-generated commit now includes a body listing the upstream commit
  messages (restricted to framework-owned paths) between the previously
  synced commit and this one, so the commit records *what* changed, not just
  that a sync happened. Falls back to a note if the previous commit can't be
  found upstream (first-ever sync, or rewritten history). The same summary is
  printed to the terminal even without `--commit`, so it's visible before you
  decide whether to commit.

## [4.2.0] — 2026-07-08

### Added

- **`--commit` flag for `scripts/sync-framework.sh`.** Automatically commits
  the staged sync using the script's suggested message
  (`chore: sync framework from poetic <ref>`), instead of leaving it staged
  for manual review.

### Changed

- **`scripts/sync-framework.sh` now syncs itself first.** If the script
  changed upstream (e.g. a new framework path was added to it), it re-runs
  the updated copy before syncing anything else, so newly added paths are
  picked up in the same run instead of needing a second manual re-run.
- **`.poetic-version` is staged automatically** by `scripts/sync-framework.sh`
  alongside the other synced files, rather than being left unstaged.

## [4.1.1] — 2026-07-08

### Added

- **Generic `.song-item-embed` / `.song-item-link` type classes** on each song
  item, alongside the existing `.song-item--<service>` modifier. They let
  `custom.css` target every embed- or link-type handler at once rather than
  service by service.

### Fixed

- **The parentheses around link-type songs (e.g. Suno) are no longer part of
  the link.** They were emitted by `::before`/`::after` on the `<a>` element, so
  they picked up link styling and hit area. They now sit on the enclosing
  `.song-item-link` div, outside the anchor. Override `content` on
  `.song-item-link` (or a `.song-item--<service>` modifier) in `custom.css` to
  change or remove them.

## [4.1.0] — 2026-07-08

### Added

- **Configurable song handlers.** Song links and embedded players are now
  defined by YAML handlers instead of being hardcoded per service. Audiomack
  and Suno ship as builtins (`src/song-handlers.yaml`); consumers add their
  own services (YouTube, Spotify, …) under `song_handlers:` in
  `.poetic-config.yaml` — no framework code needed. Adding a service needs
  only YAML (a `link_url` and/or `embed_url` template, with `{token}`
  substitution) plus CSS. See [`docs/BUILD.md`](docs/BUILD.md#custom-song-handlers).

### Changed

- **Audiomack player CSS classes renamed** to generic `.song-embed-*` /
  `.song-item--<service>` / `.song-link--<service>` (was
  `.load-audiomack-btn` / `.audiomack-container` / `.audiomack-player`).
  Style custom handlers in `custom.css` via the per-service modifier classes.
- **The `.poem` audio section grammar is now a generic `<Service>[: value]`
  line** — a service name (bare for presence, or followed by `: value` to
  supply a track ID or URL) — instead of hardcoded `Audiomack` / `Suno:`
  keywords. Existing poems using `Audiomack` and `Suno: ...` are unaffected,
  since those are now just the builtin services.

### Fixed

- **The dev server's live `/all-poems` route now includes the footer.**
  `src/tools/serve-static.js` reused its own duplicate of
  `all-poems.html` generation, which diverged from the real build (no
  favicon/subtitle sync) and omitted the footer from `src/tools/footer.js`.
  It now reuses `src/tools/build-all-poems.js`'s `concatenateAllHtmlFiles`
  directly, so the live route matches the built `all-poems.html`.
- **`scripts/sync-framework.sh` now syncs `scripts/check-build-artifacts.sh`.**
  It was missing from `FRAMEWORK_PATHS`, so consumers running `npm run
  check:build` (including CI, via `.github/workflows/build-poems.yml`) got
  "No such file or directory" instead of the build-artifact smoke test.
- **`scripts/sync-framework.sh` no longer aborts silently on a tag conflict.**
  The upstream tags fetch now passes `--force`, so a consumer's stale cached
  copy of a poetic tag no longer causes `git fetch` to reject the update and
  abort the whole script (under `set -e`) with no error message.

## [4.0.0] — 2026-07-08

### Changed

- **`.poetic-config` is now `.poetic-config.yaml` (breaking).** The config
  file moved from `key=value` lines to YAML. `skip_paths` is now a YAML list
  instead of a comma-separated string, and `auto_sync`, `blogger_sync`, and
  `show_footer` are now real YAML booleans instead of the strings `"true"` /
  `"false"`. `blogger_blog_id` must be quoted as a string — it exceeds
  `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` and loses precision as a YAML number. All other
  keys are unchanged. Consumers must rename and convert their config file;
  `readPoeticConfig` logs a warning (and treats config as empty) if it finds
  a leftover `.poetic-config` but no `.poetic-config.yaml`. See
  [`docs/BUILD.md`](docs/BUILD.md#poetic-configyaml).

## [3.2.0] — 2026-07-08

### Added

- **Site footer.** Every built page — individual poem pages, `index.html`,
  `all-poems.html`, and `public/raw/index.html` — now gets a footer reading
  "Built with Poetic" (linking the framework repo) alongside the Poetic logo,
  sourced from the new framework-owned `public/poetic-footer.html`. Two new
  `.poetic-config` keys control it: `show_footer` (set to `false` to omit the
  footer; default `true`) and `footer_source` (path to a custom footer HTML
  file; default `public/poetic-footer.html`). Rebuilding is idempotent — the
  footer is replaced in place rather than duplicated on each build. See
  [`docs/BUILD.md`](docs/BUILD.md#footer).

## [3.1.0] — 2026-07-07

### Added

- **Alternatives in plain text.** The reserved `poetic-alternatives` span class
  marks options in an alternatives group: two or more spans carrying it that are
  directly adjacent (no separating characters) are treated as alternatives. The
  HTML keeps every option (wire up your own toggle); the `raw/` plain-text output
  keeps the last option and drops the rest. Three or more options are supported.

### Fixed

- **Multi-class spans.** `/.a.b{x}` now emits `<span class="a b">` (multiple
  classes, as documented) instead of `<span class="a.b">` (a single dotted
  class). Hyphenated single classes such as `/.text-highlight{x}` are unchanged.
- Hardened the raw converter against edge cases: an out-of-range numeric
  character reference (e.g. `&#99999999;`) is left literal instead of aborting
  the build; `%{title}`/`%{author}` are decoded before use as context values;
  the index page's no-remote fallback links to the repo-root `raw/` directory.

## [3.0.1] — 2026-07-07

### Changed

- **Raw plain-text output (`raw/<stem>`) is now produced by the canonical
  engine.** `npm run poem-to-raw` parses each poem through the same pipeline as
  the YAML/HTML build (`src/tools/poem-to-yaml.js`) instead of a separate Perl
  reimplementation, so the full variable spec — multi-line definitions,
  nested/late-bound `${name}` references, `${name:-default}` fallbacks,
  `\${...}` escaping, `.shared.poem` variables, and `%{...}` context variables —
  is applied to the raw output, matching the HTML. Section labels and opaque
  embedded blocks (raw HTML, Markdown tables) are omitted from the plain text,
  and the browsable `public/raw/index.html` escapes poem titles. The previous
  shell/Perl implementation (`scripts/poem-to-raw.sh`) is removed.

## [3.0.0] — 2026-07-06

### Changed

- **Nested variables now use dynamic (late) binding.** A `${...}` reference
  inside another variable's value is resolved each time the outer variable is
  *used*, against the referenced variable's current value — so redefining an
  inner variable (for example, per poem) changes later expansions of a shared
  variable that references it. **Breaking**: the previous eager/self-reference
  behaviour is gone; a reference cycle (e.g. `={a}=${a}`) is now left as the
  literal `${a}` with a warning instead of being resolved.
- **Literal blocks suppress Markdown, not substitution.** Author `${...}`
  variables are now substituted inside raw `<<<...>>>` blocks. **Breaking**: to
  emit a literal `${...}` inside a block, escape it as `\${...}`.

### Added

- **Default values** in a reference: `${name:-default}` uses `default` when
  `name` is undefined.
- **Escaping**: `\${...}` (and `\%{...}`) emit a literal `${...}` / `%{...}`.
- **Build-time context variables** with a `%` sigil — `%{slug}`, `%{title}`,
  `%{author}`, `%{date}` — resolved at the render stage, so they work anywhere
  including inside literal blocks (e.g. an interactive `<script>` needing the
  poem's slug). **Breaking**: the previously hardcoded `${slug}` substitution in
  postscript content is replaced by `%{slug}`; migrate `${slug}` → `%{slug}`.
- The eager/early-binding variable form (a leading `!`, e.g. `={!name}=` or
  `${!name}`) is **reserved** and raises an error until it is implemented.

## [2.4.0] — 2026-07-06

### Added

- **Labels search scope** on the all-poems page — the text filter can now match
  poem labels, toggled alongside Titles and Lyrics (on by default).
- **Clickable labels** — a label shown anywhere on the site links through to the
  all-poems page pre-filtered to that label.
- **URL-driven filters** — the all-poems filter reads its state (query text,
  active scopes, date range) from URL parameters on load and keeps the address
  bar in sync as it changes, so a filtered view is shareable and bookmarkable.

### Changed

- On the Blogger site, the in-content poem-labels list is now hidden, since
  Blogger shows each post's labels through its own theme scaffolding.

## [2.3.0] — 2026-07-06

### Added

- **Metadata section** — `.poem` files may end with a new `====`-delimited
  Metadata section holding directives and labels, one per line. See
  `docs/POEM-SYNTAX.md` for full syntax.
- **Labels** — a poem's labels are displayed with the poem on the generated
  site (both the poem's own page and its index card).
- Poem labels are attached as Blogger post labels on sync, reconciled in full
  against each post's existing labels; a label containing a comma is not sent
  to Blogger, since Blogger uses commas to separate labels.
- **Directives** are parsed and preserved in the poem's data for future use;
  no directive behaviour is defined yet.

## [2.2.3] — 2026-07-05

### Fixed

- CI/deployment workflows now use actions and a Node.js version that target
  the current Node 24 Actions runtime, instead of the deprecated Node 20 one
  (`actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-node`, `actions/configure-pages`,
  `actions/upload-pages-artifact`, `actions/deploy-pages` bumped to their
  latest majors; build/sync Node.js version bumped from the EOL 18 to 22).
  Consumer repos deploying to GitHub Pages were seeing deprecation warnings
  and at least one outright deploy failure caused by the forced runtime
  switch.

## [2.2.2] — 2026-07-05

### Fixed

- All-poems text filter: matching lyrics no longer fuses adjacent lines into
  one word at a `<br>` boundary (e.g. "cavernous" followed by "Now" on the
  next line reading as "cavernousNow" — a false-positive match for "snow").
  Line breaks are now normalised to spaces before the poem body is searched.

## [2.2.1] — 2026-07-05

### Fixed

- Home page title filter: the search input is now wired even when the filter
  bar is already present in the page, so filtering works on freshly built
  (default-template) `index.html` pages and not only on self-healed ones.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-07-05

### Added

- The home page (`index.html`) now has a live title filter above the poem grid —
  typing narrows the visible poem cards to matching titles.
- The all-poems page (`all-poems.html`) now has a filter bar with a text search,
  a two-LED scope control (search titles, lyrics, or both — both by default),
  and an earliest/latest date-range filter. The filters combine, and hidden
  poems are also hidden from the table of contents.

### Fixed

- The `index.html` self-heal now replaces the whole managed render block in one
  idempotent step, so repeated builds no longer accumulate duplicate copies of
  the poem-grid helper functions.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-07-05

### Added

- The home page (`index.html`) now shows each poem's date under its title,
  formatted in the visitor's browser locale (long month name, no weekday) —
  e.g. "4 May 2015" or "May 4, 2015" depending on locale.

## [2.0.1] — 2026-07-05

### Fixed

- `sync-blogger.js` no longer runs its removal pass when `--only <slug>` is set.
  A filtered run only populates the "current" set with the targeted poem, so the
  removal pass previously treated every other managed post as removed and
  drafted (or deleted) them. Removals are now computed on full syncs only.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-07-05

### Changed

- The URL slug is now taken from the source filename stem (the `.poem` basename) instead of
  the `title`. Two poems sharing a title no longer overwrite each other — each gets its own
  `public/<stem>/` page, `public/<stem>.html` redirect, index/all-poems links, and
  `raw/<stem>` file. The build now fails if two sources resolve to the same slug. Collections
  whose filenames already match `slugify(title)` see no URL change; where a filename differs
  from `slugify(title)`, that poem's URL and `raw/` filename change to match the filename.
- Blogger posts are now published at 00:00 GMT of the poem's date (was 12:00) and are
  identified by slug, so same-titled poems become separate posts. New Blogger posts receive
  a date-stamped permalink (the day is prepended to the title at creation, then removed) —
  e.g. `/1998/01/18-my-shepherd.html`; existing posts keep their permalinks.

## [1.1.2] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed

- The `.hidden` utility now forces `display: none !important`, so elements
  hidden via JavaScript actually disappear even when another rule sets their
  `display`. The postscript "See more"/"See less" toggle set its own
  `display: inline-block` in a later, equal-specificity rule, which overrode
  `.hidden` on source order; the toggle therefore stayed visible even when the
  runtime gate suppressed it, so it appeared on notes with nothing meaningful
  to reveal. This completes the [1.1.1] fix, whose suppression decision was
  correct but had no visual effect.

## [1.1.1] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed

- The postscript "See more" preview toggle no longer appears for notes whose
  content is only a fraction of a line longer than the preview budget. The
  runtime gate (`evaluatePostscriptPreview` in `public/poetic.js`) previously
  measured hidden content with `scrollHeight`, which includes the trailing
  bottom margin of the note's last child; that margin could push the
  measured "hidden" amount past the one-line threshold even though almost no
  real text was clipped. It now measures the true content bottom from the
  last child's bounding rect, excluding that trailing margin.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-07-04

### Changed

- Block parameter **values** now follow POSIX shell-style quoting: a value may concatenate adjacent unquoted, single-quoted, and double-quoted segments; a backslash escapes the next character (with the usual double-quote handling for `"`, `\`, `$`, and `` ` ``); and `${var}` substitution applies per segment — in unquoted runs and double-quoted segments, never in single-quoted ones. An unquoted, unescaped comma, closing parenthesis, or whitespace ends a value. Output for existing poems is unchanged.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-04

### Added

- **Block parameters** — any brace-labelled block (version labels `{{...}}`, segment labels `{...}`, postscript labels `{...}`) may carry an optional parameter list after the closing brace(s): `{Label}(key=value, ...)`. Whitespace is flexible; keys are letters/digits/hyphens/underscores; values are quoted or unquoted with shell-style variable substitution. See `docs/POEM-SYNTAX.md` for full syntax.
- **Postscript "See more" preview** — postscript labels accept `preview` (default `true`) and `preview-lines` (default `5`) parameters. When enabled, long postscript notes are truncated to the specified line count with a "See more ⮟" / "See less ⮝" toggle; if hidden content is one line or less, preview is disabled and the note displays in full. Set `preview=false` to disable preview for a note.
- **Blogger publishing** — optional automatic publishing of poems to a Blogger blog on push to `main`, enabled per-repo via `blogger_sync=true` in `.poetic-config`. Includes a new GitHub Actions workflow (`Sync to Blogger`), the `sync:blogger` and `blogger:auth` npm scripts, JS injection into the Blogger theme template (via `npm run build:blogger`), and a setup guide at `docs/BLOGGER.md`.
- **Stale artefact warnings** — `npm run build:yaml` now warns when the YAML directory contains `.yaml` files with no corresponding active `.poem` source; `npm run build:poems` warns when `public/` contains `.html` files with no corresponding YAML source.

### Changed

- **BREAKING** — a well-formed parameter list `(...)` after a block label is now parsed as block parameters instead of ignored; previously, any trailing text after a label was ignored.
- **BREAKING** — postscript notes now truncate long content to 5 rendered lines by default with an expand/collapse toggle; set `preview=false` to disable this and display notes in full.
- `poem-to-raw.js` is now a pure shell wrapper; the outdated pure-JavaScript
  fallback has been removed.

### Fixed

- `build-all-poems.js` no longer leaves a `public/`-prefixed favicon href in
  the generated `index.html`/`all-poems.html` when `.poetic-config` sets
  `favicon=public/<file>`. The prefix is now stripped the same way
  `build-poems.js` already strips it for individual poem pages, so the
  favicon resolves both under `npm start` (which serves `public/` as the web
  root) and on GitHub Pages.

## [0.2.3] — 2026-06-29

### Fixed

- `sync-framework.sh` no longer prints commit instructions when no files were
  changed by a sync.
- `poem-to-raw.sh` now correctly expands variables defined in `.poem` files.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-29

### Added

- **Standalone poem pages** — each poem is built as a full styled HTML document
  at `public/<slug>/index.html`.  The old flat URL `/<slug>.html` is kept as a
  redirect stub forwarding to the new URL.
- **Shared Audiomack loader** (`public/poetic.js`) — a single delegated `click`
  listener replaces per-poem inline `loadAudiomackPlayer` functions; audio
  buttons now use `data-*` attributes instead of `onclick`.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-28

### Added

- Initial public release of the Poetic framework.
- **`.poem` syntax — trailing text rule**: trailing text on any line-anchored
  token (dividers `----`, end markers `====`, segment labels `{...}`, block
  comment markers `<<#` / `#>>`, literal block markers `<<<` / `>>>`, version
  labels) is explicitly ignored, enabling inline comments
  (e.g. `----  # end of first version`).
- **Build pipeline**: `.poem` → YAML → HTML via Pug template (`npm run build`).
- **`scripts/sync-framework.sh`** — pulls framework-owned files from the
  upstream `warwickallen/poetic` repo and records the synced ref in
  `.poetic-version`.
- **`.poetic-config`** — user-owned settings file supporting `favicon`,
  `subtitle`, `skip_paths`, `auto_sync`, and `sync_schedule`.
- **Scheduled auto-sync** via GitHub Actions (opt-in via `auto_sync=true` in
  `.poetic-config`).
- YAML `date` field uses ISO format (`yyyy-mm-dd`) for reliable string sorting.
- Analysis content uses blank-line paragraph separation; the build converts
  blank lines to `<p>` tags automatically, so `<p>` tags are not needed in the
  YAML source.
