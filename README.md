# Poetic

A plain-text poem authoring framework. Write poems in a concise `.poem` format, build them into HTML, and optionally publish to GitHub Pages.

## What it does

- **`.poem` format** — a readable plain-text syntax for structured poetry (see [`docs/POEM-SYNTAX.md`](docs/POEM-SYNTAX.md) and the formal grammar in [`poem-syntax.ebnf`](poem-syntax.ebnf))
- **Build pipeline** — converts `.poem` → YAML → HTML with a Pug template
- **Index & all-poems view** — generates `index.html` and `all-poems.html` for browsing your collection
- **Vim syntax highlighting** — filetype detection and highlighting for `.poem` files (see [`editors/vim/`](editors/vim/))
- **GitHub Pages deployment** — included workflow deploys your published HTML on push to `main`

## Quick start

### 1. Create your own repo

Pick the approach that suits you:

| | **Template** *(recommended)* | **Clone + rewire** | **Fork** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Setup | Click **Use this template** on GitHub, then clone your new repo | Clone poetic, then change `origin` | Fork on GitHub, then clone your fork |
| After setup | `origin` already points to your repo | Must rewire `origin` before you can push | `origin` points to your fork |
| Git history | Clean slate | Inherits poetic's history | Inherits poetic's history |
| Auto-sync | Yes, once `.poetic-version` is in place | Yes, once `.poetic-version` is in place | Yes, once `.poetic-version` is in place |
| Best for | Writing poems | Writing poems | Contributing to poetic itself |

**Clone + rewire steps:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/warwickallen/poetic.git my-poems
cd my-poems
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/my-poems.git
```

**Fork caveat:** If you open a pull request against `poetic` from a fork that also contains your personal poems, those poems appear in the diff. A separate repo (template or clone + rewire) keeps your collection and framework contributions cleanly apart.

### 2. Install and initialise

```bash
npm install
bash scripts/sync-framework.sh   # creates .poetic-version
git add .poetic-version
git commit -m "chore: initialise poetic version tracking"
git push -u origin main
```

`.poetic-version` identifies this repo as a poem collection (as opposed to the framework repo itself) and records which version of the framework you are tracking. It is required for automatic updates to work.

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages

In your repo settings, set Pages source to **GitHub Actions**.

### 4. Write your first poem

```bash
cp src/poems/poem/_example.poem src/poems/poem/my-poem.poem
# Edit it, then:
npm run build
npm start   # open http://localhost:8080
```

## Poem format

A `.poem` file looks like this:

```
My Poem Title
A Poet
2024-01-15

{Verse 1}
First line of the poem
Second line, with *emphasis* and **strong**.

{Chorus}
A recurring refrain,
sung with joy.
```

See [`docs/POEM-SYNTAX.md`](docs/POEM-SYNTAX.md) for the full specification and [`src/poems/poem/_example.poem`](src/poems/poem/_example.poem) for a working example that exercises every feature.

## Authoring workflow

### Create a poem

```bash
# Write a new poem
cp src/poems/poem/_example.poem src/poems/poem/my-poem.poem
# Edit it, then build
npm run build
```

### Convert to YAML (and back)

```bash
# .poem → YAML
node src/tools/poem-to-yaml.js src/poems/poem/my-poem.poem

# Convert all .poem files at once
node src/tools/poem-to-yaml.js --all

# YAML → .poem
node src/tools/yaml-to-poem.js src/poems/yaml/my-poem.yaml
```

### Shared variables

Edit `src/poems/poem/.shared.poem` to set variables available to every poem (e.g. `={author}=Your Name`).

## Repository structure

```
src/
├── poems/
│   ├── poem/         # .poem source files (your poems go here)
│   └── yaml/         # Generated YAML (and _shared.yaml for shared content)
├── templates/        # Pug HTML template
└── tools/            # Build scripts
public/               # Generated HTML (git-ignored by default)
docs/                 # Documentation
editors/vim/          # Vim syntax highlighting
examples/             # Worked examples
scripts/              # Helper shell scripts
test/                 # Tests
```

Files beginning with `_` (e.g. `_example.poem`, `_shared.yaml`) are excluded from the build.

## GitHub Pages

The included workflow (`.github/workflows/build-poems.yml`) builds and deploys to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`. Enable GitHub Pages in your repo settings (source: GitHub Actions).

## Staying up to date

### Versioning

Poetic uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Each release is tagged `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` on the `main` branch, and a GitHub Release is created automatically.

### Manual sync

After cloning, add poetic as a remote and sync framework files whenever you like:

```bash
bash scripts/sync-framework.sh            # sync from the ref in .poetic-version
bash scripts/sync-framework.sh --ref main           # always take the latest commit
bash scripts/sync-framework.sh --ref v1.2.0         # pin to a specific release
```

The script fetches the `poetic` remote, checks out all framework files at the requested ref, and updates `.poetic-version` with the synced commit. Review the staged changes, then commit.

### Automatic sync (GitHub Actions)

The included workflow (`.github/workflows/sync-framework.yml`) checks for updates every hour and opens a pull request if framework files are behind. Scheduled runs are **opt-in**: create a git-ignored `.poetic-config` file in your repo root to enable them:

```
auto_sync=true
sync_schedule=weekly
```

`sync_schedule` controls how often the workflow actually does anything (default `weekly` if omitted):

| Value | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `weekly` | Runs once per Monday at 09:00 UTC *(default)* |
| `daily` | Runs once per day at 09:00 UTC |
| `hourly` | Runs every hour |

Add `.poetic-config` to your `.gitignore` so it stays local. Manual runs via **Actions → Sync framework from poetic → Run workflow** always work regardless of this setting.

`.poetic-version` controls the update channel:

| Setting | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `channel=releases` | Opens a PR when a new semver tag is published *(recommended for most users)* |
| `channel=main` | Opens a PR whenever `poetic/main` has new commits |

To switch channels, edit `.poetic-version` and change the `channel` line.

To trigger a sync immediately (e.g., to pick up a specific release), use **Actions → Sync framework from poetic → Run workflow** and optionally enter a ref.

### Contributing back to poetic

If you improve a framework file (a tool, template, editor integration, or doc), please open a pull request against [warwickallen/poetic](https://github.com/warwickallen/poetic). Personal poems and your `README.md` stay in your own repo.
