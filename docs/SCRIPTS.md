# Shell scripts reference

This document covers the shell scripts in `scripts/`.  All scripts are
framework-owned and synced from upstream poetic — do not hand-edit them if
you want changes to survive the next sync.  For local overrides, add the path
to `skip_paths` in `.poetic-config`.

---

## `scripts/edit-poem`

Open a `.poem` file in vi by name, and automatically rebuild if the file is
saved with changes.

### Usage

```bash
scripts/edit-poem [PATTERN]
```

`PATTERN` is matched case-insensitively against `.poem` file paths under
`src/poems/`.  Shell-style anchors are supported within the pattern:

| Pattern form | Matches |
|---|---|
| `PATTERN` | any path containing PATTERN as a substring |
| `^PATTERN` | paths starting with PATTERN |
| `PATTERN$` | paths ending with PATTERN (before `.poem`) |
| `^PATTERN$` | exact basename match |

### Examples

```bash
scripts/edit-poem shepherd      # open the poem whose path contains "shepherd"
scripts/edit-poem ^my-poem$     # open my-poem.poem exactly
scripts/edit-poem ^at           # open any poem whose filename starts with "at"
```

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Poem opened (build triggered automatically if the file was modified) |
| `-1` | No poems matched PATTERN |
| `N > 1` | N poems matched (ambiguous); titles listed to stderr; no file opened |

### Notes

- Rebuilding is triggered by comparing the md5 checksum of the file before and
  after editing.  If you exit vi without saving, no rebuild occurs.
- The editor is always `vi`.  To use a different editor, call it directly and
  run `npm run build` manually.

## `scripts/setup-linux.sh`

Wrapper that activates nvm before running a command.

### The problem it solves

On Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), the system `PATH` typically includes the
Windows `node` and `npm` binaries before any Linux-installed ones.  Invoking
`npm run build` directly can therefore call the Windows versions, which fail
silently on Linux-style paths.  This wrapper loads nvm so the correct Linux
Node.js is active, then exec's the rest of the command line.

On macOS or native Linux without nvm, the script is a transparent pass-through
— nvm is only loaded if `~/.nvm/nvm.sh` exists.

### Usage

```bash
./scripts/setup-linux.sh npm run build
./scripts/setup-linux.sh npm run build:all
./scripts/setup-linux.sh <any command>
```

### Notes

- The script uses `exec`, so it replaces the current shell process — there is
  no overhead from an extra shell layer.
- The nvm version selected is the default (`nvm use node`), i.e. the most
  recently installed version.  To pin a version, set a `.nvmrc` file in the
  repo root.

## `scripts/sync-framework.sh`

Pull framework files from the upstream `warwickallen/poetic` repository into
this repo.

The poetic framework owns the build tools, templates, editor integrations, and
documentation.  Running this script fetches the requested ref, checks out each
framework-owned path at that ref, and updates `.poetic-version`.

### Usage

```bash
scripts/sync-framework.sh                  # sync using ref in .poetic-version
scripts/sync-framework.sh --ref v1.2.0     # sync from a specific tag
scripts/sync-framework.sh --ref main       # sync from latest main
```

### Arguments

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--ref <ref>` | Git ref (tag or branch) to sync from.  Overrides `.poetic-version`. |

### Workflow

1. Adds (or updates) a `poetic` git remote pointing at the upstream repo.
2. Fetches all tags and branches from `poetic` (unauthenticated, so CI auth
   headers do not interfere with the public repo fetch).
3. Resolves the requested ref — first as a remote branch, then as a tag.
4. Checks out each framework-owned path at the resolved commit.
5. Skips any paths listed in `skip_paths` in `.poetic-config`.
6. Updates `.poetic-version` with the synced channel, ref, and full commit hash.

### After syncing

```bash
git diff --staged                        # review what changed
git commit -m "chore: sync framework from poetic <ref>"
```

If `scripts/sync-framework.sh` itself was updated during the sync, re-run the
script once more to pick up the new version before committing.

### Skipping paths

To keep a local override of a framework file, add it to `.poetic-config`:

```
skip_paths=public/poetic.css,public/poetic-logo.svg
```

Comma-separated paths are compared exactly against the framework path list.

### Notes on CI authentication

GitHub Actions injects a repo-scoped `GITHUB_TOKEN` as an HTTP extra-header
that matches all `github.com` requests by prefix.  The script clears this
header for the one fetch command that targets the public poetic repo, so the
request goes out unauthenticated.  This is a no-op locally where the key is
not set.

## `scripts/remove-trailing-spaces.sh`

Remove trailing whitespace from all git-tracked files in the repository.

### Usage

```bash
bash scripts/remove-trailing-spaces.sh
```

### Behaviour

- Iterates over all files tracked by git (`git ls-files`).
- Skips files that do not exist on disk (e.g. deleted but still tracked).
- **Skips `.poem` files** — trailing double-spaces in `.poem` files are
  meaningful (they signal a forced line break in the `.poem` syntax).
- Modifies files in place and prints a summary of what changed.

### Output

```
Removing trailing spaces from tracked files...

✓ Modified: src/tools/build-poems.js
✓ Modified: docs/BUILD.md

----------------------------------------
Processed: 42 files
Modified:  2 files
----------------------------------------
Note: Changes have been made. Review with 'git diff' before committing.
```

### Notes

- Run this before committing if your editor does not strip trailing spaces
  automatically.
- A pre-commit hook or CI check may call this script; no manual invocation is
  needed in that case.
- Changes are written to the working tree only — you still need to `git add`
  and `git commit` them.
