# Building for GitHub Pages

This repository can be published to GitHub Pages using the included workflow.

## Build Process

Since GitHub Pages serves static files only, we use a build script to generate the concatenated "all poems" view.

### Quick Start

1. **Build the all-poems.html file:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Build and start local server:**

   ```bash
   npm run build:all
   ```

2.5 **Generate raw text files from `.poem` sources:**

   ```bash
   npm run poem-to-raw
   ```

3. **View locally:**
   - Main page: http://localhost:8080
   - All poems: http://localhost:8080/all-poems.html

### What the Build Scripts Do

#### Main Build Script (`src/tools/build-all-poems.js`)

The main build script:

1. Scans the `public/` directory for all HTML files
2. Extracts metadata (title, date, audio links) from each poem
3. Sorts poems chronologically by date using the date utility functions
4. Generates a comprehensive `all-poems.html` file with:
   - Table of contents with sorting functionality
   - All poems concatenated in chronological order
   - Custom CSS from the template
   - Interactive sorting by title, date, or audio availability

#### Date Utility Functions (`src/tools/date-utils.js`)

The build system includes utility functions for handling date formats:

- **`formatDateForDisplay(dateStr)`** - Converts ISO date format (`yyyy-mm-dd`) to display format (`DayOfWeek, DD Month YYYY`)
- **`parseDateForSorting(dateStr)`** - Parses date strings for chronological sorting, handling both ISO and display formats

These utilities ensure consistent date handling across the build process.

#### Blogger Template Script (`src/tools/build-blogger.js`)

The Blogger template script:

1. Reads and concatenates CSS from `public/poetic.css` and `public/custom.css`
2. Locates the Blogger template file `public/fragments-and-unity.template.html`
3. Finds CSS delimiters `/* ~~ CUSTOM CSS START ~~ */` and `/* ~~ CUSTOM CSS END ~~ */`
4. Replaces the content between these delimiters with the combined styles
5. Provides error handling for missing files or malformed delimiters
6. Updates the template file in place for uploading to Blogger

#### Raw extraction script (`src/tools/poem-to-raw.js`)

The `poem-to-raw` step extracts the plain-text body of each `.poem` source file to the `raw/` directory at the repository root, and writes a browsable `public/raw/index.html` linking to those files on GitHub. It parses each poem through the same canonical engine as the YAML/HTML pipeline (`src/tools/poem-to-yaml.js`), so variables — including multi-line definitions, `${name}` references, `${name:-default}` fallbacks, `\${...}` escaping, `.shared.poem` variables, and `%{...}` context variables — are handled identically across outputs. The engine's inline HTML markup is then flattened to plain text, common HTML entities are normalised to their Unicode equivalents, section labels and opaque embedded blocks are dropped, and partial files (names beginning with `_` or `.`) are skipped. Run it standalone with `npm run poem-to-raw` or let the main `build` sequence invoke it automatically.

### Workflow for Updates

When you add new poems or update existing ones:

1. Add your new poem HTML file to the `public/` directory
2. Run `npm run build` to regenerate `all-poems.html`
3. Commit and push to GitHub
4. GitHub Pages will automatically update

### Workflow for Blogger Template Updates

When you need to update the Blogger template with new CSS:

1. Edit `public/poetic.css` (framework styles, synced) or `public/custom.css` (your styles, never synced)
2. Run `npm run build:blogger` to inject the combined CSS into the template
3. Copy the updated `public/fragments-and-unity.template.html` content
4. Paste it into the Blogger template editor
5. Save the template in Blogger

The script will automatically handle the CSS injection and provide feedback on success or any errors encountered.

### Standalone poem pages and redirect stubs

Each poem is built as a **full, styled HTML document** at `public/<slug>/index.html` so that
visiting `/<slug>/` shows a properly styled page linking `poetic.css`, `custom.css`, and
`poetic.js`. The old flat URL `/<slug>.html` remains as a redirect stub that immediately
forwards the browser to `./<slug>/` via `<meta http-equiv="refresh">` plus a
`<link rel="canonical">`. The `<slug>` is the poem's source filename stem (e.g. `my-poem.poem`
→ `/my-poem/`), not derived from the title, so identically-titled poems stay distinct.

### Shared song-embed loader (`public/poetic.js`)

`poetic.js` is a tiny, framework-owned script that lazy-loads embedded song
players. A single delegated `click` listener on `document` handles every
`.song-embed-btn` button on any page (individual poem pages, `all-poems.html`,
and the live dev-server endpoint), for any service — no per-service or
per-poem JavaScript is needed.

The embed button carries the resolved embed URL and title as `data-*`
attributes, built at render time from the poem's song handler:

```html
<button class="song-embed-btn" data-embed-src="https://audiomack.com/embed/..." data-title="My Poem">
  🎵 Load Audiomack Player
</button>
```

No third-party iframe request happens until the visitor clicks the button, at
which point `poetic.js` creates the `<iframe>` inside the adjacent
`.song-embed-player` element. Player dimensions are controlled by CSS, not
JavaScript — see [Player size](#player-size) below.

Every created iframe is granted `allow="autoplay; fullscreen;
picture-in-picture; encrypted-media"` and `allowfullscreen`. This is the
global default, harmless for services that do not use those capabilities and
required for players such as MEGA to offer full-screen and
picture-in-picture. (Autoplay with sound is still blocked cross-origin by the
browser, so playback always starts from the visitor's click.) A handler can
override either via `embed_allow` / `embed_allowfullscreen` (see [Custom song
handlers](#custom-song-handlers) below); this is surfaced on the button as
`data-allow` / `data-allow-fullscreen`, which `poetic.js` reads in place of
the global default when present.

Set the Audiomack artist referenced by the builtin `audiomack` handler's URL
template in `.poetic-config.yaml`:

```yaml
song_handlers:
  audiomack:
    artist: saltysojourner
```

### Custom song handlers

Song links and embedded players are driven by declarative **song handlers** —
a mapping from a service name (as written in a poem's Audio section, e.g.
`Audiomack` or `YouTube`) to a small definition of URLs and labels. Poetic
ships three builtin handlers, `audiomack`, `suno`, and `mega`, defined in the
framework's `src/song-handlers.yaml`. Adding support for another service needs
only YAML and CSS — no framework code — by adding an entry under
`song_handlers:` in `.poetic-config.yaml`.

A handler definition may set:

- `link_url` (+ `link_label`) — renders a plain anchor
- `embed_url` (+ `button_label`) — renders a lazy-loaded iframe (see
  [Shared song-embed loader](#shared-song-embed-loader-publicpoeticjs) above);
  no third-party request happens until the visitor clicks the button
- player-size keys — `embed_height`, `embed_aspect_ratio`, `default_media`, and
  `media_sizes` (see [Player size](#player-size) below)
- `embed_allow` / `embed_allowfullscreen` — overrides the lazy-loaded iframe's
  `allow` / `allowfullscreen` attributes for this handler only (see [Shared
  song-embed loader](#shared-song-embed-loader-publicpoeticjs) above)
- `value_patterns` — infers a full value from a partial or pasted URL (see
  [Value patterns](#value-patterns) below)

At least one of `link_url` / `embed_url` is required; a handler may define
both.

**Worked example** — adding YouTube support:

```yaml
song_handlers:
  youtube:
    embed_url: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/{value}"
    button_label: "▶ Load YouTube"
    link_url: "https://youtu.be/{value}"
    link_label: "watch on YouTube"
```

With this in place, a poem's Audio section can include:

```
YouTube: dQw4w9WgXcQ
```

which renders both a lazy-loaded embedded player and a plain link to the video.

#### URL templates

`link_url` and `embed_url` are templates containing `{token}` placeholders,
resolved at build time:

- `{value}` — the text the poem author wrote after the service name (empty for
  a bare line such as `Audiomack`)
- `{slug}`, `{title}`, `{author}`, `{date}` — the poem's own context
- any scalar key at the top level of `.poetic-config.yaml`
- any scalar field set on the matched handler itself — e.g. `{artist}`, as
  used by the builtin `audiomack` handler and set via
  `song_handlers.audiomack.artist`

A **fallback chain** `{a|b|c}` resolves to the first token in the list that is
non-empty. For example, the builtin `audiomack` handler uses
`{value|slug}` — the author's value if one was given, otherwise the poem's
slug.

#### Value patterns

`value_patterns` lets a handler accept a partial or full URL as `{value}` and
infer the rest, so a poem author can paste as much of a service's own URL as
they have to hand rather than hand-extracting one exact substring. It is an
ordered list of `{ match, value? }` entries, tried in order against the raw
value (before any `{token}` substitution); the first one whose `match` regexp
matches wins:

```yaml
song_handlers:
  youtube:
    embed_url: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/{value}"
    button_label: "▶ Load YouTube"
    value_patterns:
      # Accept a full/partial youtube.com or youtu.be URL and reduce it to the
      # bare video ID.
      - match: '^(?:https?://)?(?:www\.)?(?:youtube\.com/watch\?v=|youtu\.be/)(?<value>[^&?#]+)'
```

- a named capture group (`(?<name>…)`) is merged into the token scope, so a
  group named `value` overrides `{value}` directly, and a group with any other
  name (e.g. `artist`) becomes available as `{artist}` for this song only,
  overriding a handler-level or config-level field of the same name
- an entry's optional `value` key is itself a `{token}` template, substituted
  against the scope *after* the match's own groups are merged in — use it when
  the new value needs to be built from a captured group plus fixed text (the
  builtin `suno` handler does this to turn a bare ID into `s/<id>`)
- a value that matches none of the handler's patterns — including an empty
  value, or a plain override with no URL structure at all — is left exactly as
  the author wrote it, so a bare slug override (e.g. `Audiomack: my-shepherd`)
  keeps working without needing a pattern of its own

See the builtin `audiomack`, `suno`, and `mega` handlers in
`src/song-handlers.yaml` for worked examples, and [Value overrides and pasted
URLs](POEM-SYNTAX.md#value-overrides-and-pasted-urls) in `docs/POEM-SYNTAX.md`
for the author-facing behaviour.

#### Player size

An embed handler declares the player's size. A handler that serves a single kind
of media sets one of:

- `embed_height` — a fixed CSS height (e.g. `"252px"`), the builtin `audiomack`
  handler's size
- `embed_aspect_ratio` — a fixed `width / height` ratio (e.g. `"16 / 9"`); the
  iframe height is then computed from its width

A handler that serves several kinds of media (like `mega`: audio and video) sets:

- `default_media` — the media type used when the author gives no `audio`/`video`
  token
- `media_sizes` — a map of media type → size profile, where each profile is a
  `height` **or** an `aspect_ratio`. If a profile somehow ends up with both
  keys (this can happen when a consumer override deep-merges into a builtin
  profile — see [Overriding builtin handlers](#overriding-builtin-handlers)),
  `aspect_ratio` takes precedence and `height` is ignored:

```yaml
mega:
  embed_url: "https://mega.nz/embed/{value}"
  button_label: "🎵 Load MEGA Player"
  default_media: audio
  media_sizes:
    audio: { aspect_ratio: "1 / 1" }
    video: { aspect_ratio: "16 / 9" }
```

MEGA renders an audio file as a roughly square cover-art viewport, so the builtin
`mega` audio profile uses a `1 / 1` ratio (not a fixed bar height); video uses
`16 / 9`.

Authors override the size per song with a trailing parameter list on the audio
line — `(audio)`, `(video)`, `(ratio=16/9)`, `(height=360)`, or a combination
such as `(video, ratio=21:9)`. See
[Player size and media type](POEM-SYNTAX.md#player-size-and-media-type) in
`docs/POEM-SYNTAX.md`.

At render time the resolved size is emitted as a CSS custom property on the
`.song-embed-player` element: either `--song-embed-height` (fixed height) or
`--song-embed-aspect-ratio` (with an added `song-embed-player--aspect` modifier
class). `poetic.css` consumes those, falling back to `252px` when a handler
declares no size. The resolved media type is also exposed as `data-embed-media`
and a `song-embed--<service>--<media>` class for per-media styling.

#### Embed permissions

An embed handler may override the iframe `allow` / `allowfullscreen`
attributes that `poetic.js` otherwise applies by default (see [Shared
song-embed loader](#shared-song-embed-loader-publicpoeticjs) above):

- `embed_allow` — a full `allow` attribute value, e.g. `"autoplay;
  encrypted-media"`; an empty string grants no capabilities at all
- `embed_allowfullscreen` — `false` suppresses the `allowfullscreen`
  attribute for this handler's embeds; `true` is the same as leaving it unset

```yaml
song_handlers:
  youtube:
    embed_url: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/{value}"
    button_label: "▶ Load YouTube"
    embed_allow: "autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture"
    embed_allowfullscreen: true
```

Leaving both unset (the case for every builtin handler) applies the global
default. At render time, either key is exposed on the embed button as
`data-allow` / `data-allow-fullscreen`, which `poetic.js` reads in place of
the default when present.

#### Overriding builtin handlers

A consumer entry under `song_handlers:` with the same name as a builtin
**deep-merges** into it, key by key: scalar keys are overridden, nested maps
(like `media_sizes`) merge recursively, and a `null` value deletes a key. So a
consumer can retune just one size profile without redeclaring the handler's
`embed_url`:

```yaml
song_handlers:
  mega:
    media_sizes:
      audio: { aspect_ratio: null, height: "300px" }   # switch audio to a fixed height
      video: { aspect_ratio: "4 / 3" }
```

**A size profile is `height` *or* `aspect_ratio`, and if both keys are
present, `aspect_ratio` wins** (see [Player size](#player-size) above). Because
the merge is key-by-key rather than a wholesale replace, adding `height` to a
profile that already has `aspect_ratio` (as the builtin `mega` audio profile
does) does not switch the sizing mode — it leaves `aspect_ratio` in place *and*
adds an unused `height`, so nothing visibly changes. To switch a profile from
one sizing mode to the other, null out the key you're replacing, as in the
`audio` line above. Overriding `video` needs no `null` here only because that
profile has no competing key to begin with.

#### Styling custom handlers

Styling lives in CSS, not in the handler definition. Each song gets these
generated classes, keyed on the lower-cased service name:

- `.song-item` + `.song-item--<service>` — wrapper around one song
- `.song-embed` + `.song-embed--<service>` — the embed container
- `.song-embed-btn` — the lazy-load button (shared across all services)
- `.song-embed-player` — the iframe holder
- `.song-link-anchor` + `.song-link--<service>` — the link

Add per-service rules to `public/custom.css`, for example to set the
YouTube player's height:

```css
.song-embed--youtube .song-embed-player iframe {
  height: 200px;
}
```

Every link-type item is wrapped in a `.song-item-link` div (embed-type items get
`.song-item-embed`). `poetic.css` uses that generic wrapper to add decorative
parentheses around all link handlers — placed on the div, so they sit outside the
`<a>` and are not part of the link:

```css
div.song-item-link::before { content: "("; }
div.song-item-link::after  { content: ")"; }
```

A consumer can drop the parentheses globally by overriding `content` on
`.song-item-link` in `public/custom.css` (an empty `content: "";` removes them),
or target a single service via the `.song-item--<service>` modifier.

### Customisation

The build script uses the same logic as the development server (`src/tools/serve-static.js`) but generates a static file instead of serving dynamically. You can modify the styling or functionality by editing the build script.

### `.poetic-config.yaml`

User-specific build settings live in `.poetic-config.yaml` at the repo root. This file is yours — it is never overwritten by a framework sync — and should be committed to version control so that CI picks it up when building for GitHub Pages.

Supported keys:

Keys are grouped hierarchically by feature. A fully-commented reference of
every key — copy the section you need and uncomment it — lives at
[`examples/poetic-config.example.yaml`](../examples/poetic-config.example.yaml).

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `favicon` | `poetic-logo.svg` | Filename (inside `public/`) of the browser-tab icon |
| `subtitle` | `My Poems` | Subtitle shown below the site title on `index.html` |
| `skip_paths` | _(none)_ | List of framework paths to skip during sync |
| `auto_sync.enabled` | _(off)_ | Set to `true` to enable the scheduled sync workflow |
| `auto_sync.schedule` | `weekly` | How often the scheduled sync runs: `hourly`, `daily`, or `weekly` |
| `footer.enabled` | `true` | Set to `false` to omit the footer from every built page |
| `footer.source` | `public/poetic-footer.html` | Path to the HTML file whose contents are injected as the page footer |
| `blogger.sync` | `false` | Set to `true` to enable automatic Blogger publishing via GitHub Actions |
| `blogger.blog_id` | _(required when enabled)_ | Numeric Blogger blog ID (visible in the blog URL in Blogger settings) — quote it as a string; it exceeds `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` and loses precision as a YAML number |
| `blogger.removed` | `draft` | What happens to a post when its source poem is removed: `draft`, `delete`, or `keep` |
| `blogger.content` | `full` | Content posted to Blogger: `full` (complete styled HTML page) or `poem` (poem fragment only) |
| `blogger.label` | `poem` | Blogger label applied to all managed posts |
| `blogger.template` | `public/blogger-template.html` | Path to the Blogger XML theme template file injected by `npm run build:blogger` |
| `song_handlers` | _(none)_ | Map of custom song-handler definitions (service name → `link_url`/`embed_url`/labels/size/handler-specific config), deep-merged with the builtin `audiomack`/`suno`/`mega` handlers; see [Custom song handlers](#custom-song-handlers) |

Example:

```yaml
favicon: my-icon.png
subtitle: Warwick Allen's Poems
skip_paths:
  - public/poetic-logo.svg
auto_sync:
  enabled: true
  schedule: hourly
song_handlers:
  audiomack:
    artist: saltysojourner
```

#### Favicon

The browser-tab icon defaults to `public/poetic-logo.svg`, which is included with the framework. To use a different icon, place your file in `public/` and set the `favicon` key:

```yaml
favicon: my-icon.png
```

The build will then emit `<link rel="icon" href="my-icon.png" ...>` in both `index.html` and `all-poems.html`. Any file format the browser supports works (`svg`, `png`, `ico`, etc.).

To keep the default logo but prevent it being overwritten on the next framework sync, add it to `skip_paths`:

```yaml
skip_paths:
  - public/poetic-logo.svg
```

#### Subtitle

The subtitle shown below the site title on `index.html` defaults to `My Poems`. Override it with the `subtitle` key:

```yaml
subtitle: Warwick Allen's Poems
```

#### Footer

Every page the build generates — individual poem pages, `index.html`, `all-poems.html`, and `public/raw/index.html` — gets a footer as the last element in `<body>`. By default it reads `public/poetic-footer.html` (included with the framework) and shows "Built with Poetic" linking to the framework repo, alongside the Poetic logo.

Turn it off entirely:

```yaml
footer:
  enabled: false
```

Or supply your own footer content by pointing `footer.source` at a file of your own (never overwritten by a framework sync, unlike the default `public/poetic-footer.html`):

```yaml
footer:
  source: public/my-footer.html
```

The footer source file is raw HTML, injected verbatim inside a `<footer class="poetic-footer">` wrapper. It may reference `%{base}` — the relative path prefix back to the site root (`''` on `index.html`/`all-poems.html`, `../` on one-directory-deep pages like individual poem pages and `raw/index.html`) — useful for linking an image or asset that lives in `public/`:

```html
<img src="%{base}poetic-logo.svg" alt="Poetic logo">
```

Rebuilding is idempotent: each build replaces the previously-inserted footer in place (identified by an HTML comment marker) rather than appending a new one, so `index.html` never accumulates duplicate footers across repeated builds, and toggling `footer.enabled` off removes an existing footer on the next build.

To keep the default footer file but prevent it being overwritten on the next framework sync, add it to `skip_paths`:

```yaml
skip_paths:
  - public/poetic-footer.html
```

### Publishing to Blogger

Poetic supports optional automatic publishing of poems to a Blogger blog. The feature is off by default and is enabled per-consumer via `.poetic-config.yaml`. See [`docs/BLOGGER.md`](BLOGGER.md) for the full setup guide, including one-time Google OAuth authorisation, GitHub secrets, and theme parity steps.
